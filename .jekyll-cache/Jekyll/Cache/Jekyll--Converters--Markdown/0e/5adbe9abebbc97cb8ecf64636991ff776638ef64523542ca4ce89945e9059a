<p>Jack Balkin: Have graphic designers moved toward producing platforms, instead of producing contained works?</p>

<p>Dan Michaelson: Yes, and thatâ€™s where the focus of my classes lies in particular.</p>

<p>J: What kind of platforms might you teach your students how to create?</p>

<p>D: One project in my class is to make a content management system. Thatâ€™s a very open-ended project, but the problems are straightforward: youâ€™ve got to figure out what the content should be, and thatâ€™s a decision up to each individual designer in this case. But to create a healthy ecosystem around that content, youâ€™ve got to figure out how are you asking users to enter and structure their content, how are you transforming that content through algorithm, and finally how youâ€™re presenting that content.</p>

<p>J: It sounds to me like a lot of what theyâ€™re doing is theyâ€™re engaged in software design?</p>

<p>D: To me thereâ€™s a fuzzy spectrum between graphic design, which might ask: â€œwhat does the interface look like?â€, and software design, which asks: â€œwhatâ€™s the algorithm beneath the surface thatâ€™s organizing the data.â€</p>

<p>J: So we begin the conversation with the transformation of graphic design from an earlier model (things like advertisements or posters). Youâ€™re saying, â€œWhat do I do as a graphic designer, when Iâ€™m asked by a client not to create a single unitary object, but to create a platform which others in the business will use. We want it to be functional for the goals that the client wants, but we also want it have aesthetic consistency and appeal.â€ Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re trying to do right now?</p>

<p>D: We can think of it a little more broadly. It should have a feeling that isnâ€™t just a visual feeling, but a feeling about the way it works and the cultural messages itâ€™s transmitting. And it should evolve over time in a healthy way. When you come back to this platform a year from now, it could be worse or it could be better, and weâ€™re engineering something thatâ€™s going to be better.</p>

<p>J: A lot of that depends on two things: first, the amount of leeway put into the original system. And second, the ability of the system to be generative. You can have a system that has a lot of leeway, but you canâ€™t build anything with it, because you havenâ€™t included the tools to build something new.</p>
